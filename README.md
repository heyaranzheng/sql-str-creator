# This macro generates SQL statements from rust structs



**This is a tool for my private project, so it supports Sqlite first. Some features may not be available for PostgreSQL. I do  not recommend you using this  crate if you are using PostgreSQL as your database.**


* add this crate to your project:`cargo add gen-sql-sta`
* create your structure with `#[derive(SqlSta)]`,  you can use `#[primary_key]` to mark a field as your primary key.
  The field  marked `#[ignore]` will be ignored when you generate a sql statement or something realtive to it.
* **If no field is marked with `#[primary key]` ,  macro will attempt to use  a field  name of "id" as a primary key. If "id" was already used by another field, it will fall back to "autoincrement".**
  **If neither "id" or "autoincrement" is avaliable. The macro will panic immediately.**

```
// test struct, it works if you have used generics and where clause too.
#[derive(SqlSta)]
struct Test {
  #[primary_key]
  id: u32,
  name: String,
  age: u32,
  #[ignore]
  score: u32,
}
```

* We can use the implemented funtions to get the SQL statements if we have a object test, like this: `test.create_table_sql()`


```
let test = Test {
    id: 1,
    name: "Tom".to_string(),
    age: 10,
    score: 100, 
};

//get the SQL statement
let sql_statement = test.create_table_sql();

println!("{:?}", sql_statement);
//The output will be like this:
"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, name TEXT, age INTEGER )

```

## Function Lists

`create_table_sql(&self)`:  the sql statement to create a table.      -> something like:`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ......`

`get_field_names(&self)`:  get your names of your structure's field.    ->`Vec<&'static str>`

,e.g: `vec!["id", "name", "age"]`


* The table name will always be the struct indent with all lowercase.
  'test' is the table name of `struct Test{ /*... */}`, not 'Test'
* If you don't use

## The Type Transformation From Rust to Sqlite

```
//Byte UuidBytes Hash, is a reserved type name, you can use the name as your individual type.
